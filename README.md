# NumberGuesser
This project selects a random number, allows the user to guess the number, and respond with a message confirming a match or offering a hint.</br>

Before guessing, the user is prompted to set the maximum guessable number.</br>

When the user guesses correctly, a message is returned stating the number of tries and a list of past guesses. If a user makes an invalid guess (NaN, out-of-range, repeat), this is not counted in the tally of guesses.
